**Brain-Computer Interface Movement Decoding**

The goal of this project was to create an algorithm using a support vector machine (SVM) with Two-Level cross-
validation which can determine whether someone using a brain-computer interface (BCI) intends to select a
“left” or “right” movement. The Jupyter notebook takes you through all of the steps of the process with comments.
